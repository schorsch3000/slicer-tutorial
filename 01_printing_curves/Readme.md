## Lesson 1: Understanding Curves in 3D Printing

In this lesson, we explore the impact of printing curves in different planes using the same object.

### Objective:

- Understand how the orientation of a curve in the Z-plane and X-plane affects print quality.

### Testing:

- Execute the print with default settings. (Use model.stl in this folder)
  - Filament usage: Approximately 2g.
  - Estimated print times:
    - Creality Ender 3 Neo V2 - Prusa Slicer - Normal Speed: ~30 min
    - Prusa MK4 - Prusa Slicer - Structural: ~15 min

### Observation:

1. Assess and compare the surface finish of curves on both objects.
2. **Printing in the Z-plane:**

   - Results in a smoother curve.
   - Utilizes X/Y movements to create the curve.

3. **Printing in the X-plane:**
   - Relies on layer lines to form the curve.

**Note:** Understanding the impact of plane orientation on curve printing
