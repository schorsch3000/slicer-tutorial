## Lesson 2: Stability in 3D Printing - XY vs Z

In this lesson, we examine the stability of two 90-degree angled pieces printed from the same object. One piece experiences stress along the XY movement, while the other undergoes stress partially along the Z-axis.

### Objective:

- Investigate the impact of stress orientation on stability in 3D printing.

### Testing:

- Execute the print with default settings. (Use model.stl in this folder)
  - Filament usage: Approximately 2g.
  - Estimated print times:
    - Creality Ender 3 Neo V2 - Prusa Slicer - Normal Speed: ~25 min
    - Prusa MK4 - Prusa Slicer - Structural: ~15 min

### Observation:

1. Attempt to break both models in the middle.
2. **Stress Along XY Movement:**

   - Evaluate the stability and breakage pattern.

3. **Stress Partially Along Z-axis:**

   - Assess the stability and breakage pattern.

**Note:** Layer-to-layer adhesion is often weaker than the stability of a single layer. Compare the results to understand the influence of stress orientation on the stability of 3D printed objects.
